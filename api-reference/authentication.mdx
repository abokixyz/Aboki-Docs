# Authentication

All Aboki API requests require authentication using API keys from your business dashboard.

## Get Your API Keys

1. **Visit the Dashboard**: Go to [app.aboki.xyz/dashboard](https://app.aboki.xyz/dashboard)
2. **Create Business Account**: Register and complete business verification
3. **Get Your Keys**: Access your API credentials from the dashboard

## Key Types

You'll receive three types of keys:

### **Public Key** (`pk_live_...`)
- ✅ **Use for**: API identification and all business offramp operations
- ✅ **Safe to use**: In client-side applications
- ✅ **Required for**: All endpoints in this documentation

### **Client Key** (`ck_...`)
- ✅ **Use for**: Client-specific operations
- ✅ **Safe to use**: In frontend applications

### **Secret Key** (`sk_live_...`)
- ⚠️ **Keep secure**: Never expose in client-side code
- ⚠️ **Server only**: Use only in backend applications
- ⚠️ **Not needed**: For the offramp endpoints in this documentation

## For Offramp API

**For all business offramp endpoints** (quote, verify-account, create-offramp), **use your Public Key**:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer pk_live_your_public_key_here
