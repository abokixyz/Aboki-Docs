# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. You can get your API keys from your Aboki dashboard.

## API Keys

You'll need two types of keys:

- **Public Key**: For client-side operations (safe to expose)
- **Secret Key**: For server-side operations (keep secure!)

## Headers

Include your API key in the Authorization header:



## Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.aboki.xyz/v1/rates \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer abk_test_1234567890abcdef'
