**Aboki is the fastest way to turn crypto into real money — and real money into crypto — right from your wallet or bank account.**

No middlemen. No Telegram. No waiting.

![Aboki Interface](aboki-interface.png)

Aboki lets anyone swap between stablecoins like USDC and local currency (like the Nigerian Naira) in seconds. It's simple, instant, and built for everyday use — from buying breakfast to funding your wallet or even paying for a car.

## Sample Requests

We provide sample API calls next to each method **using cURL**. All you need to do is insert your specific parameters, and you can test the calls from the command line.

### Quick Example - Get Offramp Quote

Make a `POST` request to:

`https://aboki-b2b-eobk.onrender.com/api/v1/business-offramp/quote`

with headers:

- `Authorization: Bearer pk_live_your_key_here`  
- `Content-Type: application/json`  

and body:

`{ "tokenAmount": 100, "targetToken": "USDC", "targetNetwork": "base" }`

## API Overview

The Aboki API gives you access to pretty much all the features you can use on our dashboard and lets you extend them for use in your application. It strives to be RESTful and is organized around the main resources you would be interacting with.

### Main Features

- **Offramp Services**: Convert crypto tokens to Nigerian Naira instantly
- **Onramp Services**: Convert Nigerian Naira to crypto tokens seamlessly  
- **Multi-Network Support**: Base, Solana, and Ethereum networks
- **Real-time Pricing**: Live exchange rates and liquidity validation
- **Bank Integration**: Direct Nigerian bank account verification and payouts
- **Webhook Notifications**: Real-time order status updates

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

1. **Create Account**: Visit [app.aboki.xyz/dashboard](https://app.aboki.xyz/dashboard)
2. **Complete Verification**: Complete business registration and admin approval
3. **Generate Keys**: Get your Public Key (`pk_live_...`) from the dashboard

### Step 2: Make Your First Request

Test authentication with a simple quote request:  

Endpoint:  
`https://aboki-b2b-eobk.onrender.com/api/v1/business-offramp/quote`

Headers:  
- `Authorization: Bearer pk_live_your_key_here`  
- `Content-Type: application/json`  

Body:  
`{ "tokenAmount": 10, "targetToken": "USDC", "targetNetwork": "base" }`

### Step 3: Integration Patterns

**Offramp Flow (Crypto → NGN):**
1. [Get Quote](/api-reference/offramp-quote) - Show customer NGN amount
2. [Verify Bank Account](/api-reference/verify-account) - Validate customer bank
3. [Create Order](/api-reference/create-offramp) - Generate deposit wallet
4. Customer sends crypto, receives NGN automatically

**Onramp Flow (NGN → Crypto):**
1. [Get Quote](/api-reference/onramp-quote) - Show customer token amount
2. [Create Order](/api-reference/create-onramp) - Generate payment instructions
3. Customer pays NGN, receives crypto automatically

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your **Public Key**:

`Authorization: Bearer pk_live_your_public_key_here`

## Response Format

All API responses follow this consistent structure:

`{ "success": true, "message": "Operation completed successfully", "data": { /* Response data here */ } }`

## Error Handling

Failed requests return detailed error information:

`{ "success": false, "message": "Detailed error description", "code": "ERROR_CODE", "errors": { "field": "Specific field error" } }`
